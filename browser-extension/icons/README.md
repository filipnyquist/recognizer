# Browser Extension Icons

This directory contains the icons for the reCognizer browser extension.

Since we can't generate actual PNG files in this environment, here are the specifications for the icons that should be created:

## Icon Specifications:

### icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
- Small icon for the extension toolbar
- Should contain the ðŸŽ­ theater masks emoji or a simple "R" logo
- Background: Transparent or light blue (#2196F3)
- Text/Symbol: White or dark blue

### icon32.png (32x32 pixels)
- Medium size icon for extension management
- Same design as 16px but more detailed
- Can include "reCognizer" text if space allows

### icon48.png (48x48 pixels)
- Standard icon for extension details
- Full logo design with "reCognizer" text
- Theater masks or shield symbol with AI circuit pattern

### icon128.png (128x128 pixels)
- Large icon for Chrome Web Store
- Full branding with "reCognizer" text
- Detailed design with theater masks, AI/tech elements
- Professional appearance suitable for store listing

## Design Guidelines:
- Use the theater masks (ðŸŽ­) as the primary symbol representing "recognizer"
- Blue color scheme (#2196F3) to match the popup UI
- Clean, modern design that works well at all sizes
- Should be recognizable even at 16x16 pixels

## Temporary Solution:
For development and testing, you can use simple colored squares or find Creative Commons icons online that match these specifications.
